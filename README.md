#### By _Qian Li_ ðŸ˜Š

#### This is my c# project for practice which demonstrates uses of one to many relation in sql database workbench. 

## Technologies Used

* C#
* Microsoft.NET.Sdk
* sql workbench
* VS code

## Description

It will serve as a a website where users can add their favorite restaurants based on the type of cuisine they offer. A user should be able review restaurants too.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone â€œBest-Restaurants.solutionâ€œ from the repository to your desktop_.
* _Navigate to "Best-Restaurants.solution" directory via your local terminal command line_.
* Run the app, first navigate to this project's production directory called "BestRestaurants". 
* In the command line, run `dotnet run` in the "BestRestaurants" directory to run the app. 
* Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).
* Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.
* To optionally run the test, open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's test directory called "BakeryShop.Tests".
* Run `dotnet test` in the command line invoke MSTest to run tests. The results of running the tests will appear in the terminal.
